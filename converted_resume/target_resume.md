EXPERIENCE
Techlent Inc.  										        Pleasanton, CA (Remote)
Data Scientist					       						       05/2024 – 12/2024
Led a team of 3 interns to develop a recommender system to support promotion strategies for inventory clearance.
Analyzed 621,935 sales records, 5,095 product listings, and 265,547 customer profiles through data cleaning, feature extraction, and EDA. Designed and rapidly tested multiple machine learning models within two weeks. 
Presented insights and technical proposals to the company’s executive team, receiving highly positive feedback.
Achieved precision@20 of 2.68%, 24× higher than before, doubled sales and saved at least $20K in advertising.

AI Engineer											       10/2021 - Present
Project 3. AI Agent for Research
Built an agent to automate literature review, PDF extraction, hypothesis generation, and manuscript refinement.
Built the system with LangGraph and LangChain, integrating tools for web search, PDF parsing, and document retrieval. Implemented RAG and advanced prompt engineering for complex research tasks and model evaluation.
Experienced with OpenAI SDK, CrewAI, and Qdrant vector database.
Project 2. Agricultural Pest Monitoring and Classification
Served as lead engineer, developing an object detection pipeline to monitor and classify pest species from field camera images, supporting sustainable agriculture and effective pest management.
Trained a YOLOv5-based detection model for localization and a ResNet classifier for species identification on GCP, using a balanced and augmented 5 GB dataset covering 80 pest species. 
Achieved over 80% IoU with YOLOv5 and >80% classification accuracy across all species.
Project 1. Environmental Pollutants Detector
Served as lead engineer, developing a model to screen thousands of chemicals and identify key pollutants.
Applied chemistry expertise in feature engineering, resolved overfitting, and improved model applicability by designing a metric to estimate model uncertainty. Rigorously test model performance across chemical categories. 
Delivered a Neural Network model with 10× higher accuracy than domain experts. Built a Flash web app, containerized it with Docker, and open-sourced the code on GitHub. The app helped reduce test costs by 80%.
Principal investigator on a research grant and first author of a paper. Won first prize in a research competition.
